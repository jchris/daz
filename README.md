To build this app:

Check it out from github

Download the latest Couchbase.framework from http://www.couchbase.org/get/couchbase-mobile-for-ios/current

Drop the Couchbase.framework into the `MYCHECKOUT_DIRECTORY/Frameworks/` folder.

Click run, now you should be able to hit the Couch on <http://localhost:5985> if you are on the simulator, or your device IP address if you are on a device.
